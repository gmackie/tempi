## TemPi
A quick repo for setting up a grafana dashboard for a wireless thermomoter for a smoker


### Setup Instructions
Pretty straight-forward. Just run the script. Takes care of setting up `rtl_433`, `influx`, and `grafana`. Also creates a script to automatically import results from thermopen into `influx`
```
./setup.sh
```
